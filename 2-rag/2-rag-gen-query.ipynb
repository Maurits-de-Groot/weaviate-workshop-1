      "Airplanes fly using a combination of complex flight control systems and the physical design of their wings. The main controls of an airplane allow the pilot to direct the aircraft in the air by controlling the attitude (roll, pitch and yaw) and engine thrust. This is achieved through the use of various components such as ailerons, rudders, flaps, and elevators, which are all part of the airplane's control system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wings of an airplane are crucial for its ability to fly. They have flexible surfaces which are stretched across a frame and made rigid by the lift forces exerted by the airflow over them. This design allows the wings to provide lift, a force that counteracts the weight of the airplane and keeps it in the air. Larger aircraft have rigid wing surfaces which provide additional strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design of the wings can vary. For example, some wings have a double-taper planform, a relatively low aspect ratio, and fuel tanks permanently attached to the wingtips. The trailing edge of these wings has double-slotted trailing edge flaps inboard of mass-balanced ailerons. These flaps and ailerons, along with the rudder and elevators, are crucial for controlling the airplane's movement in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, airplanes can take off under rotor lift like a helicopter, then transition to fixed-wing lift in forward flight. This type of aircraft is known as a convertiplane.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the flight of airplanes is quite different from that of birds, the principles of aerodynamics apply to both. For example, the flight of hummingbirds has been studied intensively from an aerodynamic perspective, providing valuable insights that can be applied to the design and operation of aircraft.\n",

An automatic trimming system was present, the flaps and the trim system being connected in order to counteract the potentially large pitch changes that would otherwise be generated by vigorous movements of the flaps. The tall, swept vertical tail has an inset rudder. Variable-incidence horizontal stabilizers with inset elevators are mounted at the base of the rudder and over the exhaust nozzle. Side-by-side airbrakes are located under the fuselage ahead of the wing's leading edge. The flaps, landing gear, wheel brakes and air brakes are powered by a hydraulic system.
